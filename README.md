# toll_booth_finder

This is a small project that I'm working on for a friend. I'm extremely busy with university and side-projects right now so code is poorly written and sparsely commented. Thus is sort of a minimum-working version.

This code can be used to find the number of toll booths that could possibly be crossed between multiple points. Please credit
